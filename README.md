## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/img/checkout.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  - [demo](https://dochekout.surge.sh)
- What was your experience?
  - very basic
- What have you learned/improved?
  - I've learnt how to make forms accessible for all people
  - I've learnt how to enable users fill required fields by giving signals when a required field is not filled, also by showing clearly which fields are optional
  - I've learned how to make the forms look good using css.
- Your wisdom? :)
  - even on slow days keep moving forward!
